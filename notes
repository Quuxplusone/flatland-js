Things that need doing:

- rename confusing variables (eg canvas -> context)
- animation (using requestAnimFrame probably)
- populate shapes on start up instead of waiting for them to spawn and come on screen
- better UI/controls
- a few things are hard coded in the source that should be parameterized
- add inverse power/logorithmic formula instead of linear for distance
- add configuration options for changing size/frequency and other things
