### Flatland

*Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions*, written by Edwin A. Abbott and published
in 1884, is a novel about a square who lives in an entirely two-dimensional world.
The book explains how he, and all two-dimensional creatures, see their two-dimensional
world in one dimension, similar to how we three-dimensional creatures see our world
as a series of two-dimensional images.

### Flatland Simulator

I was curious about what it would be like to see the world like a Flatlander does
and threw together this program with JavaScript and HTML5's canvas tag.
You control a little square in a world of randomly generated polygons.
Move and rotate using `WASD` or the arrow keys; strafe with `ZX`.

You can "play for points": Use the keys `1`â€“`9` to greet the polygon in front of you.
(`2` greets an Irregular Triangle.) Correct identification of a previously unidentified
individual earns points; incorrect identification loses points.

Use `+` to toggle display of a crosshairs (for greeting purposes).

Finally, you can cheat by using `~` to toggle display of an overhead view
in addition to the in-universe view. But where's the fun in that?
